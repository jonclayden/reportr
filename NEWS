Significant changes to the reportr package are laid out below for each release.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.3.1

- Tests have been moved from "testthat" to "tinytest".
- Package anchors have been added to documentation references to ore::es(), as
  now required for CRAN.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.3.0

- The new assert() function reports a message (by default an error) if its first
  argument produces an error or does not evaluate TRUE.
- The ask() function gains a "valid" argument, which specifies valid responses.
  If it is given, the user will be asked repeatedly until they give a suitable
  answer.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.2.2

- The report() function now checks whether the output level is low enough for
  the message to be displayed, before constructing it. This can save a lot of
  overhead time when many debug-type messages are to be skipped over.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.2.1

- Use of the "%p" syntax in a prefix format string previously caused an error.
  This has been corrected.
- The tests have been updated for compatibility with a new version of testthat.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.2.0

- The "ore" package is now used by "reportr". It provides improved versions of
  some of the package's auxiliary functionality. As a result, the s() function
  and %~% and %!~% operators are no longer exported by "reportr". Please see
  es(), %~% and %~~% from "ore" instead.
- It is now possible to configure the level at which the stderr stream is used,
  using the "reportrStderrLevel" option.
- A "Fatal" output level has been added. In practice it is never used, but the
  output level can be set to it, to suppress all output.
- Flags are now reported at the end of a call to withReportrHandlers().
- The ask() function now also returns the default value if the R session is
  noninteractive.
- The return value from getOutputLevel() is now named with the level name.
- A set of tests, and a README file, have been added to the package.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.1.2

- The "level" argument to report() or flag() may now be given without the "OL$"
  prefix, viz. report(Info, "Test").

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.1.1

- The s() function is now vectorised on its first argument.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.1.0

- Expression substitution is now performed on messages, using Ruby-like syntax.
  This allows R expressions to be interpolated into message strings for brevity
  and clarity.
- Error messages and stack trace elements are now truncated to keep output
  readable.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.0.1

- Messages are now only printed to stderr() when their level is Warning or
  higher.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.0.0

- Errors generated within the expression passed to withReportrHandlers() are now
  reported with information on the call, if available. Relevant information
  should therefore no longer be lost when using reportr, as opposed to the
  standard R error-reporting system.
- A "reportrStackTraceLevel" option is now available, allowing for the
  generation of stack traces at lower output levels than Error if required. The
  default behaviour is as before.
- The clearFlags() function has been added, which removes any pending flags.

=================================================================================

VERSION 0.2.0

- Substantial reworking of the package for greater generality. New functions
  ask(), getOutputLevel() and withReportrHandlers(), and new infix operator
  %!~%, have been added. Arguments to other functions have been changed in some
  cases. The principal mechanisms of report() and flag() remain the same,
  however.
- A series of new options can be used for flexible message and stack filtering.
  See ?report for details.
- The format of the string prepended to messages can now be customised, rather
  than just switched on or off. See ?report for details.
- The new function withReportrHandlers() evaluates an R expression in a context
  in which reportr handles any errors, warnings and messages raised by it.
- The new function ask(...) replaces report(OL$Question, ...).
- Various other tweaks have been made, including one for compatibility with
  changes coming in R 2.14.0.

=================================================================================

VERSION 0.1.0

- First public release.
