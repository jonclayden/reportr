Significant changes to the reportr package are laid out below for each release.

=================================================================================

VERSION 0.2.0

- Substantial reworking of the package for greater generality. New functions
  ask(), getOutputLevel() and withReportrHandlers(), and new infix operator
  %!~%, have been added. Arguments to other functions have been changed in some
  cases. The principal mechanisms of report() and flag() remain the same,
  however.
- A series of new options can be used for flexible message and stack filtering.
  See ?report for details.
- The format of the string prepended to messages can now be customised, rather
  than just switched on or off. See ?report for details.
- The new function withReportrHandlers() evaluates an R expression in a context
  in which reportr handles any errors, warnings and messages raised by it.
- The new function ask(...) replaces report(OL$Question, ...).
- Various other tweaks have been made, including one for compatibility with
  changes coming in R 2.14.0.
